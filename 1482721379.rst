A list of sites, with puzzles and enough information
to implement them.

`Quantified self`_, contains a lot of interesting talks and papers, with a lot
of interesting ideas. I've been tracking basic things like tasks, expenses and
incomes for quite a while, it has been quite useful, but that data is
self-hosted, for accounting, everything is stored in plain text, using `ledger`_
and tasks are also being stored in plain text using `org-mode`_, everything is
hosted in a couple of private git repository.

Tracking more data than the absolute necessary (except for `music`_), seemed a
little bit silly, considering that the information will probably be stored by a
third-party, but things like measuring one's own mood, could be quite
beneficial, at least that it's the impression that I get after having
read/listen, `this`_ `, this`_ `and this`_.

I will be using moodscope, it suggest that you should have a "buddy", to whom
you should be held accountable, and should also provide feedback, however, I
prefer to make the chart public, it should serve for the same propose.

Using `Rescuetime`_, to track the time spent on all applications should throw
interesting results...
